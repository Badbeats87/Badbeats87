👋 Hi! I'm a technical writer in the SaaS workforce management (WFM) space, with a strong focus on clarity, usability, and making complex systems understandable.

💡 Outside of work, I build small tools and scripts — most recently using Python to control synthesizer parameters (Roland JD-Xi) via Raspberry Pi and nanoKONTROL2.

🎛️ My interests include synthesizers, Raspberry Pi projects, and self-taught explorations in mathematics and physics. While I have no formal training in these areas, I approach them with curiosity, persistence, and a hands-on mindset.

📁 This GitHub mainly hosts personal experiments and projects that reflect my passion for learning and technical problem-solving.
